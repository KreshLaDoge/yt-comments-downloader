It was like middle of 2017 when i first listened to his songs on SoundCloud, i was in a super bad moment of my life in high school - that still haunts me though -, i used to listen to his music every single day til the moment i saw the news on internet. I instantly stopped listening to his songs and deleted SoundCloud off my phone. A few months later i missed his voice and i forgot the way the songs used to make me feel, i got 2 tattoos as a memory of all the feelings i had for him as a singer. I miss him releasing new songs and i always come back here to listen to my favorite track. I hope you&#39;re fine wherever you are, Peep. We all miss you so much.
😭
Rest in peace, young legend...
I really missing gus
Rst in peace
i miss him
lil peep more like pp
Makes me think about them🥺🖤♥️
.
Me and this problem of just listening to people when they are dead, its like when they gone i feel more the music, Rip to all the rappers that are gone to soon.

I made 4 remixes. Lemme know whatchu guys think . <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialjasso/sets/dont-wait-for-me-ep">https://soundcloud.com/officialjasso/sets/dont-wait-for-me-ep</a>

My gf chose other guy over me.this music hits so bad on me. Thought on doing terrible things such as taking my life. Ppl  will never  understand the value of real love. Just feel  destroyed and depressed. Trying my best to no kill myself.
(*)😭
Descansa en paz 💔
Most
Я так скучаю....
&lt;3
&lt;3
Ему было плевать что о нём думают, он писал и пел для души(Это наталкивает меня на мысль, &quot;Сука что бы было сейчас когда он пел бы, после карантина миллион людей на концертах, куча новых песен)
he died for our sins
This song makes me sob.
Still love pee 😭
linda vc
Y his subs goin up n down??💔
You&#39;ll live on. You created an entire genre all your own. You were pure and it is sad that you aren&#39;t with us anymore. RIP peep🖤🎶
This shit slaps to hard 💯
I just need me a Gøth ßitch, ain&#39;t none where I am
This song literally Described my life
Lo mejoor @lil peep 😍
Nashee😍😍😍
Dejen de llamar &quot;possers&quot; a personas que lo conocieron después de su muerte, sos posser si te gustan solo (por ejemplo) 3 canciones de el y ya te consideras &quot;fan&quot;, pero después no escuchas ninguna más de el artista y nisiquiera te interesa este<br /><br /><br />Hay muchos que dicen ser fans de peep pero nisiquiera se saben 2 canciones, y la única que se saben es save that shit o en si las más conocidas
but knew that you were absolute in doubt..
goat
So official audio was meant to be extended
Finally a orginal version fucking OG song
Peep &amp; Wicca are the greatest combo. <br /><br />Shame things had to end the way they did. RIP hellboy
“There&#39;s a silhouette inside a lucid dream I project myself on you, then back to me”
When gus starts singing I start viding
how does this piece of art only have 494k views??
Cambio mucho de  la versión  original :((( ♡
“I remember you were climbing on top of me. Why you actin like you fuckin forgot me?” Felt that. Love you Peep 💯
Legends 🥀🥀
I’m gonna cry
I miss peep😔
I just really wanna talk to you
This shit be hitting harder than my grades
Wicca!
Fucking love it lol 💯💯🔥 wavy music 🌊🏄‍♂️
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23longlivepeep">#longlivepeep</a>
i make beats, check em out and give me thoughts?
i always come back and comment and then i see my comments and i realize shit. weird
Перевод песни lil peep m.o.s <br />Грядут значные вещи <br />Shema boys влетают<br />Это банда сука знай и нет это не пустой треп <br />Выебал телку и вот снова заряжен <br />Мне ещё много предстоит найдёшь меня на концерте <br />Ещё много предстоит мы не закончили сука <br />Перережу твою глотку я не закончил братан <br />Сейчас я под наркртой оставь одного <br />Парни за спиной ведь я не один <br />Я не чувствую  лица помоги <br />Я не чувствую лица <br />Я не чувствую лица помоги <br />Я не чувствую лица <br />Я не чувствую лица помоги<br />Я не чувствую лица <br />Я не чувствую лица помоги<br />Я не чувствую лица <br />Грядут значные вещи <br />Shema boys влетают <br />Это банда сука знай и нет это не пустой треп <br />Выебал телку и вот снова заряжен <br />Мне ещё много предстоит найдешь меня на концерте <br />Ещё много предстоит мы не закончили сука <br />Перережу твою глотку я не закончил братан <br />Сейчас я под наркотой оставь одного <br />Парни за спиной ведь я не один <br /><br /><br /><br />Нуууууу думаю русские теперь знают перевод этой песни если вы конечно это читаете 😎
There’s times where my depression hits me too hard and I just have to overcome all of my emotions and a way that helped me a lot was to not be sad at the fact that lil peep is gone but to be glad that he came to this world to help us all when I listen to his music
Who was there because you listen this song in lil peep&#39;s document?
my whole body gets chills listening to this
Fake video, Star shopping - video
(Long Lives Lil Peep🕊️🖤💙🖤)
Guys every time i play a song or see him i cry
One of my favorite songs from peep
Do the only thing I hate is that I didn’t know about his music in 2017 and before that 🥺
This that fuckin Cask of Amontillado type shit.
Мы скучаем по тебе
listening 4:20am
Care vrea boabe?
Почему я узнал о нём, только тогда, когда он умер 😔<br />Помню тот день.. ненавижу ноябрь😓
I have a strange question, what are those pants he is wearing?

Here, you who read it, yeah you this heart is for you becouse you are true lil peeps fan here is it : &lt;3
🖤LEGENDARY 🖤<br />               💔
Queria que ele pudesse ter lido isso antes de ir, mas, eu o amava, por mais que não nos conhecermos, ele me fazia bem, ele faz falta na minha vida e acredito que na vida de várias pessoas também.<br />    Choro toda vez que escuto uma música dele, eu espero todos os dias que o jornal anuncie que ele está vivo, e que apenas estava escondido por motivos pessoais, espero isso a 3 anos, e vou aguardar minha vida inteira após está notícia.
Stop say who is stilling here, <br />True fan never left 💖💖
What&#39;s the song of that sample? Death cab for cutie? Anyway I damn near shed a thug tear listening to this

So ig all of his songs were a suicide letter 😢😢
&quot;If she don&#39;t love me for my money then she love me for me&quot;<br />Man that line resonates with me. All my past love interests have never shown me the same energy and commitment that I devoted to them. If I die before I ever find the one that loves me for me, I won&#39;t even be surprised at this point.
He legend
We miss you so much here peep

I’m glad I get to listen to him. Couldn’t have made it a few times without it. Pulled me from some places I didn’t think I’d get out of. Lil Peep will always be a legend, peep is my nirvana. 25 Y.O. And still wouldn’t have it any other way. Love you man, thanks for everything now and in the future.
dói o coração so de lembrar....

I really do feel like a ghost boy like no one ever hits me up im well known to people but no one wants hang out unless I hit them up first I dont get check up on, whenever I have problems I ask for help but they say they are busy but whenever they need help I give them great advice and they just leave...honestly I think I&#39;m just gonna end it all

этот инструментал🤤 просто нечто
Sssoooo much Bone Thugs N Harmony influence in this song.
Does anybody else feel like the music publishers are trying really to make money off his death? releasing old song over and over again it feels like they don&#39;t care if they are tarnishing his image
hits different when you&#39;re the ghost boy

Llp
Man this is awesome music to wake up to before heading to class... I graduated this year and our grad trip was suppose to be to Los Angeles... Could of been perfect to hear this track in Los Angeles...
This song motivates me to cut off all the toxic people who are holding me back and focus on myself.
LA CARRERA PÓSTUMA DE PEEP DURARÁ HASTA EL 2023 O 2024

ScreaM 🤔
Listen, if you weren&#39;t jamming to lil peep drumming his fingers on the desk in 3rd grade. You&#39;re not a real peep fan. smh...
The end always gets me because I know the feeling of long periods of isolation
I miss the good old days, when lil peep was still alive, and we could go everywhere, and we used to feel like “damn, how does he go through all of this depression and still be so upbeat?” Now we are all up at 4:00 am listening to old music, r.i.p lil peep
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMOipsG1LQI&amp;t=3m19s">3:19</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMOipsG1LQI&amp;t=3m30s">3:30</a> hit different right now
this song has got me goosebumps since it was just the recording of concerts
😔💔💔
Here is what i have to say about people making a big deal about &#39;fake fans&#39;:<br />people who hate fake fans: I F**king hate fake fans<br />me: wait who?<br />people who hate fake fans: well fake fans of cour...<br />me: cares. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Its so annoying enjoy the music
R.i.P our Legend! 💔😭
We love gustav😈😈😈😈🍑🍑

This song so beatiful! 💔
If he was still here I’d be so happy
I don&#39;t know what i do without you 😔
The 1.6k that commented are the only real fans because this was after death and the likes people could’ve just came across it
It kinda sounds like Peep did this over some trash lil peep type beat
I miss peep so fucking much bruh.He died young but lived a long life.
Es verdad que quedan 85 canciones por sacar de Peep?
I wish i could listen to this song without crying :(
Эх был пацан и нет пацана press f
How could I forget about you? I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you.
It&#39;s so sad if you think about it, not saying this to shame him but he was so insecure (I know cuz I am too), for example, &quot;send me one text so I can get some rest&quot;, &quot;lonely sunset without my princess&quot;. He was never able to fully detach from his muse. :(
Ma ex
This song is from my dog when I leave the house without her for five minutes
How could I forget about you?<br />How could I forget about you?<br />How could I forget about you?<br />(Send me one text, so I can get some rest)<br />Yah<br />Forget about you?<br />I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you<br />Lonely sunsets without my princess<br />(Ripped jeans, big screens, bad bitch and she 18)<br />Send me one text, so I can get some rest<br />(She could be my lady, yeah)<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />How could I forget about you? (What?)<br />I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you (GBC)<br />Lonely sunsets without my princess<br />Send me one text, so I can get some rest<br />How could I forget about you? (Forget about you)<br />I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you (Do without you)<br />Lonely sunsets without my princess (Without my princess)<br />Send me one text, so I can get some rest (I can get some)<br />How could I forget about you?<br />I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you (Do without you)<br />Lonely sunsets without my princess (Without my princess)<br />Send me one text, so I can get some rest<br />How could I forget about you? (Forget about you)<br />I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you (Do without you)<br />Lonely sunsets without my princess<br />Send me one text, so I can get some rest<br />How could I forget about you? (Forget about you)<br />I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you (Without you)<br />Lonely sunsets without my princess<br />Send me one text, so I can get some rest
I first heard this song through my brother......now I cant listening to it
He is brilliant and he&#39;ll never die. He speaks people&#39;s lives on his songs
&lt;z3
peep is happy now.
This is beautiful 😭
It&#39;s because moths go to the light 🙏 rip peep
Need this version on Spotify again.
R.I.P lil peep
it&#39;s so sad that lil peep died
the movie &quot;the f**k it list&quot; brought me here and i&#39;m gladd
This song reminds me of my boyfriend everytime me and him don’t talk I listen to this to remind he is here
What give me the most chills is, that when I watch this shit, this is just everything Peep would´ve wished to happen. Gus you´re where you are waiting for us. Peace.
😭
Lip.peep.fans😊😊😊
Ah no mames, que triste ver que no sale Peep

Starting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JOQLAZpKo8&amp;t=2m27s">2:27</a> the song sounds super  like an early 2000s punk band
If the lil peep community weren&#39;t so toxic and didn&#39;t leak peep songs, the popularity and influence of peep would be great. Anyway, I miss you Lil Peep Greetings from Argentina

Я буду любить тебя вечно 🥺😣💞
I felt the &quot; I told you I can do it&quot;...
okay now i actually love my country
Forever in my heart
This sounds like a cover of hear shape box performed by a female producer i found online .
F
I can’t explain him, he’s just perfect, his voice, his music, he’s everything and I miss him everyday
Я один слышу звуки нокии на песне?
He really deserved better 😭💔
I love you Lil Peep!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭
i love you lilpeep i will have you in my heart
Прости что я узнал тебя после смерти (((я так тебя люблю
where are my people from belgium /waar zijn de belgenn??
L☹VE🔫🖤💜❤
Miss you😭
this song on shrooms &amp;acid is amazing
drugs are boring to be honest, once you reach a certain point and you end up alone in studio getting high and making music, just to cope with loneliness and empty feeling inside you.. world suddenly becomes dead and silent and you&#39;re left all alone with your art. That&#39;s where the overdose happens.. It&#39;s a complicated, but part of it is needed for artistic purposes, it&#39;s just that no matter what, but you have to stay alive through it all.
Most of the disliks are cuz of the gab3
🥺😍
Br?
😩u would pay all my money to het gus back 😢
gab3 is underrated on all three of the songs, change my mind
yo why it lowkey sounds like first date by blink 182
❤️❤️❤️❤️
666 Kommentare hielt ich für kein gutes Omen. <br />Also auch alles für Peep da oben :D <br />You Never Dead we ca heare you clear
How the fuck dat nigga gab3 got more features than Tracy or Makonen, I mean, wtf
That intro reminds me too much of Curt Cobain
I wanted to hear that while i make my make up but I’m crying all the time I hear his voice.  He was, is and will be there forever 🙏
Como me arrepiento de no haber conocido su música antes
Gab3 is the fucking goat. Fuck the haters
lol wish i was dead fr
Nirvana vibez 🤘🏽✨
❤️
Don&#39;t be sad he&#39;s dead, smile because he was born.&quot; Copied spread the word
&quot;I&#39;ll be inside -I&#39;m makin music to cry to&quot;...
Don&#39;t be sad he&#39;s dead, smile because he was born.&quot; Copied spread the word
The people who listen to this everday with me are truly depressed 😭 hey I&#39;m kenadie
Lil Peep was just born with the voice and talent. Even though his songs were kind of short, he killed the lyrics and you automatically knew who Peep was when he was featured on a song just by his approach.
Rip peep
&quot;Don&#39;t be sad he&#39;s dead, smile because he was born.&quot; Copied spread the word
Played this 5 times the day it dropped :(

All access entertainment is milking lil peeps existence with the slave contact they offered him it made him very depressed and un inspired, they the same management of lil uzi.

Мы любим и помним тебя Peep !!!!!!! 😥

Esta versión es más apagada ☹
Peeps voice in the original is so raw and you can feel the energy in his voice. <br />Rip Peep
YouTube is always taking me back to this place.
This is stuck n my head I can’t get it out <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh and every time I hear this song I forget he’s gone 😞
this is so commercial shit
🗡️do me some wrong 🗡️
Man i love the Original Version.<br />The voice of Peep and iLoveMakonnen it&#39;s amazing.<br />The beat is so diferent and relaxing.
this sounds so bad. the fall out boy version is sm better
🥰🥰🥰
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IHt46YMLW8&amp;t=2m57s">2:57</a>❤❤
The problem is... Makonnen stoped music without saying anything... he deleted his ig and doesnt post music
this makes me nostalgic about something but i don&#39;t know what... unu
I love this version!! 🤪
original version very best i dont remember version fall out boy
What power
RIP LIL PEEP (2020)
No Fall Out Boy or Panic in the Disco..They are the same band.. but they did a good job with this track. But this is way better
His voice is ~✨ fucking beautiful ✨~
Man the energy is reall.ℹ
Both versions are good to me, as long as peep is there.
I just fell in love with a bad bitch<br />Told me that she love me too, baby, I&#39;m not havin&#39; it<br />Sniffin&#39; cocaine, &#39;cause I didn&#39;t have no Actavis<br />Smokin&#39; propane, with my clique and the bad<br />Bitches call me Cobain<br />She can see the pain<br />Look me in the eyes, girl, we are not the same<br />Bitch, I&#39;ll make it rain on my side bitch, shout out to my main<br />Fell in love once, and I never been the same<br /><br />Lil Tracy, I used to rob, but I shop now<br />Comin&#39; up, I might get recognized when I walk around<br />Coolin&#39; with Lil Peep, let&#39;s hit the mall tomorrow<br />I&#39;ma mix American Eagle with some Ralph Lauren<br />I got a bad bitch who is good to me<br />Baby, I see passion in your eyes, when you look at me<br />I&#39;ma show you off, like some Louis V<br />Coke lines on the mirror, snort a line for me<br /><br />I just fell in love with a bad bitch<br />Told me that she love me too, baby, I&#39;m not havin&#39; it<br />Sniffin&#39; cocaine, &#39;cause I didn&#39;t have no Actavis<br />Smokin&#39; propane, with my clique and the bad<br />Bitches call me Cobain<br />She can see the pain<br />Look me in the eyes, girl, we are not the same<br />Bitch, I&#39;ll make it rain on my side bitch, shout out to my main<br />Fell in love once, and I never been the same

2020💔 я до сих пор тут
Soundcloud emo King 🎃🎵🎃
He is a god ❤💫<br />I see the movie and i love it
I watched this documentary in flight with Delta on the way from my home state of PA to where I live now in MN. I stumbled across it by total fucking accident and it turns out it was one of the BEST things to ever come across. I wish I would&#39;ve known about his music when he was alive and though I feel guilty for that, I am so greatful that he left us his gift of immense talent. He was hot too I ain&#39;t gonna lie. RIP lil peep - you are greatness!
This dude has a defently different style that he combines in his music if he was still alive he would definitely be on top of the music world in 2020
Yo where’s kirblagoop
Q lloré dice:(❤️
😭💕
If I&#39;d get a movie/documentary or whatever it would be called &quot;nobody&#39;s, anything&quot;
Не понимаю что они говорят, но всё равно ставлю лайк..
miss Gus.
I was too little to like peep when he was alive. My best friends older brother would always play him, Mac Miller, and $uicideboys. I hated all of it because I didn’t understand it. Now I do and I’m beyond upset I never liked him when he was alive. I watched everybody’s everything with the same older brother and best friend and we all cried and just blasted his music afterwards. Love you peep❤️🐣
We will all meet him in heaven god bless you all
He was suffering so much but meanwhile people enjoyed seeing the pain😭😭 RIP PEEP 11-1/11-15. I will remember his deathdate foever because its 1 day after my birthday
I see the movie and I love the lil peep grandfather
I almost cried
alena moje lasko
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV7qfPcyaXQ&amp;t=0m49s">0:49</a>. &quot;when i met him, he just know... does anyone know what he said? btw, it&#39;s a shame that Posty didn&#39;t appear in the movie.
He never really died, his body might be gone but his spirit lives on for forever.
I miss him like he was my best friend...
“Momma my phones about to die”                             “Are you with anyone?”                                                  “Tracy”
Is this the gummy bear album???????
he’s looking down on us all
&quot;Leave me alone&quot; 💔
Ghost Boy ❤️ Belgium ❤️
Am i the only one who realized this album came out on the day he died but 2 years later?😭😭
Belgium’s the best
😿😿😿
🖤🖤
I MISS PEEPY

I&#39;m 49 and never listen to this kind of music. But I LOVE Lil Peep! So talented. So raw and emotional.  His music really speaks to me.

I thought there will be Fanngirl mv like Belgium mv that just contain his tour footage :(
Why did peep have to die🥺 like WHYYYY GOD WHYY....??!! Why did you have to take him 😔😞😞😞 WHYYY
Amazing ✨💔
Who else is in quarantine and remembers him with love?
“Run away make friends with the moon” <br /><br />You did it🥺🕊💕.
W pewnym sensie, kurde! Przecież on śpiewa o tym co się stało :\\

Peeeep💔😭☹️😭💔☹️
09/07/2020 ❤
Forgive me for loving U
I&#39;m happy to see yet another video of Gus well done: him (Jesus), a cigarette, a beer (I think) and a leather jacket. All of this shot in a hotel or pub bar. Fortunately the director, following Peep&#39;s idea of making simple but concrete videos, did not choose to insert special effects. Why does he represent the best? Because he is called Lil Peep.
I love it❤️
Damn this hurts so fucking much now, it&#39;s like I forget he passed when I vibe out to his songs. I miss you angel :(

I’ve never met someone like Lil Peep. I’ve tried to understand how I can phrase into words what I feel about this guy but it’s unlike other. I understand that there’s other great artists out there who are up to their greatest potential and are known worldwide but Peep...Peep is different. I came across his music about three months ago and it is absolutely non-tiring to listen to on repeat. Wow. See you on the other side Peep 💗🕊
LiL PeEp
I am real punk and I love punk music and Peep music and his COWYS songs: U said, Better off dying, the brightside and problems are for me punk songs.  Yes I am Peep fan from 2017. I miss him  Rip Gustav.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pGbGjSD9kA&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a> time stamp for me lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pGbGjSD9kA&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> hits different ngl
one person can help millions but millions can’t help one
Don&#39;t ask who&#39;s here in 2020 or June or July or sumn, his fans never really left n never will  leave..stfu all of y&#39;all clout chasers!!
Just imagine how many people are listening to this song with you right now
I love you peep rip
Alguien que hable español? Que también piense que las rolas de peep son otra onda 😎🇲🇽
Your scrolling threw the comments remembering him with love

Peep deserves so much more recognization,  he is literally my favorite person 🥺
Lil peep en cuarentena bro.
Music en mis oidos👽leyenda  lil peep
Он был таким классным, хорошим, красивым, таким простым. Еще этот запоминающийся образ, его ахуенные волосы, просто идеал. Слушаю каждый день в течении нескольких лет, никогда не надоест😌<br />Лучший. Земля пухом❤️
lets appreciate horsehead 💜👻
if he was still here he would be helping everyone through this year I just know it R.I.P Lil Peep you will be missed bro
I hate the fact that ppl call juice wlrd a legend but they dont even say nun to lil peep
😍❤
Как же плохо понимать, когда твой любимый певец умер...
Such an amazing soul 💗💋
yk i know we all lover peep but can i say how good horse head looked
these girls are literally so pretty
No offense but horsehead ruined this song.

🔥🔥🔥🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤
Why isn&#39;t this on spotify
This has so much aesthetic
When I listen to peep my fucken hairs stand up and it feels like Gus and the other ones I’ve lost are with me at that very moment. His music is a trip. Love it.
He said everybody know I&#39;m next that shit scary
Why does he kinda look like jake Paul in this video
<b>YO NO ESTOY LLORANDO USTE ESTA LLORANDO</b> :&#39;3
Miss u Peep
I just noticed that this song is abt lil tracy  bc before his death Tracy and peep weren&#39;t on good terms-
I wish Lil peep was here :)
Every time at 2 in the morning I listen to this
rock in fucking Paradise, Gus...rock in fucking.. paradise...
thumbnail looks like sodapoppin lmao?
July 2020 without you 💔💔
Blow straw spotted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbgaRbyWTW8&amp;t=2m35s">2:35</a>
Idk where this was filmed but it’s beautiful just like gus love u always man rest in peace bro 😥❤️
Era hermoso
🤕
stop making me cry
S2
his music and personality  is what made me like lil peep in the first place: his individual and doesn&#39;t follow the rules of give a fuck about what everyone things. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23foreverpeep">#foreverpeep</a>. <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gothangel">#gothangel</a>. xo xo
Beautiful
Yeah. I remember when I had so called friends, that were jealous of me, leave me to die also. One of peeps best. Especially after  the doc
Mix is whack, love this song
Gothic angels surround the society of shadows where I’ll dwell reaching calibers well I’ve seen <br />Well I’ve been through visions <br />Of life’s final destination <br />In the making then there’s those taking <br /><br /><br />Medicine to drown remember man down <br />While death surrounds I’m immortally Known <br />Underground within chambers charmed <br />Jesus turn off the alarms <br />Armed and dangerous <br /><br /><br /><br />I crash into timelines <br />You crash through my time <br />I crash into timelines <br />You crash through my line <br />I crash prime time <br />Love me while I’m dying fine <br /><br /><br /><br />She’s the best within the whirlwind <br />A women of stone for the wolf <br />Bringing it home to my heart<br />Of hearts I’m heart broken forever coasting
Can relate,<br />They are fake, they are acting like they really care but they dont give a fuck, one day they tell you that they do understand what you feel but the fuckin next day they will blame u and tellin you that you fakin cause you wanna be in spotlight
Why do you even need this club 27?!
Miss you legend
A Legend left this World
Rest in Paradise. Life is very short guys, repent to THE LORD JESUS CHRIST because you never know when you&#39;re gonna go and HE is the only way to Heaven and GOD THE FATHER.
RIP Lil peep
Song hits different when you deal with a bunch of bs on a daily basis..💔 I runaway from my problems tho
if u think bout it it&#39;s funny how lyk works;)

Miss you peep
We all love you, king🐥🖤
If i could have 3 wishes they would all be to have him back...
imagine being emma and listening to his songs knowing they&#39;re about you
Everytime I listen to this song I think about my girlfriend and the times we hanged out at our library in February. It was really cold and we didn&#39;t have a car so we would just take a Uber or walk there. I was going through shit and whenever I was with her I just felt like for a moment everything will be okay. Thank you Lil Peep even though you&#39;ll never see this. My girlfriend and I love your songs. I love you Ismerai Gonzalez Garcia 08/06/19 ❤️
I never heard of him until he died. I know it&#39;s painful for those close to him but his death gave me his life and I&#39;m sitting in my garage feeling like shit and his music helps. It doesn&#39;t make me feel better but it let&#39;s me know I&#39;m not the only one hurting.
I miss lil peep bro :(  Fuckk man this man had a new vibe to him. The world took a good one :((((
We dont know who when dies but their memories never fade away we miss you legends rest in heaven
That sigh in the beginning gives me this nostalgic sad feeling about someone I always used to make sigh:/
This needs more views
My favorite song ever the beat is so good
We miss you Gus
Te amamos peep

God I miss him so much. Forever in our hearts gus. We love you ❤️

Que paja que la versión original esté opacada por la de x, igual son temones
Easter egg on bottom where it says sunlight on your sking above it says ILOVEMAKONNEN and other side has xxx hinting towards X being on falling down

This is way better than the version with X tbh. No disrespect to X, I love his music, I just prefer this version of the song
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

First time hearing this: *Trash song*.                           Second time hearing this:*Just fine*.                             Third time hearing this: *Ok damn not bad*.               Fourth time hearing this: FUCK MY LIFE CANT SAVE THAT GIRL DONT TELL ME YOU CAN SAVE THAT SHIT
Hey guys I’m a really big peep fan and an aspiring producer so I wanted to make a few peep remixes over my beats and I think for the most part I did a pretty good job &amp; he would approve. I made 4 remixes. Lemme know whatchu guys think . <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialjasso/sets/dont-wait-for-me-ep">https://soundcloud.com/officialjasso/sets/dont-wait-for-me-ep</a>

Let&#39;s learn to love our enemies before we hate them because, at the end of the day..we dont know how much time we will have on this earth.
I FEEL such pain - over losing Jahseh and Peep-

The fact how he was rapping about doing a deal with the devil then died in 2017 is scary. <br /><br />“I made a deal with the devil” <br /><br />“Take what the devil offered, I got nothing to lose” <br /><br />Rip peep

Why you dead. 😢
i wish more than anything that you were still here
He is an legend
No puedo superar tu muerte, desearía que estuvieses aquí, te merecías el mundo entero. Pequeño ángel, te amamos Peep, abrazos hasta donde quiera que estés :(
Sigo llorando todas las noches, pensando que tú muerte es solo una pesadilla, en cualquier momento me gustaría despertar y saber que aún sigues aquí. La vida no es lo mismo sin ti, pequeño ángel. El tiempo va a pasar cada vez más rápido y seguiremos recordándote con mucho amor, físicamente te has ido, pero siempre vivirás en nuestros corazones. <br />Hoy miré el cielo, vi una estrella y supe que ahí estabas, por tu forma tan hermosa y única de brillar. <br />Descansa en paz pequeño Gus. 🖤
him doing drugs breaks my heart.
Thanks for the clip💜
Y&#39;all lucky you guys think this is some new music, i knew this song since 2016 😭

I dont wanna be one of &quot;those&quot; nut jobs but this sounds like he still alive. Changed my name shaved my heard tell my friends that im dead. Kinda sus if you ask me
Parts of this song could be the opening to a tv show or sum idk why it just has that vibe
Para los que los que no lo saben, esta canción utiliza la misma instrumentalización que Wonderwall de Oasis.<br />Solo el dato para los que no lo sabían, sé que más del 90% acá lo sabrá, pero para los que nunca habían escuchado Wonderwall se las recomiendo xd<br /><br /><br />Igual me encanta Lil Peep (no tengo hate contra él, lo aclaro pvtos)
Tanto tiempo y aqui sigo, tú música nunca morirá peep ni el sentimiento por que aun duele tu partida a todos nos duele
Dude just stole oasis background music 😂😂
i just got a dog and named him gus his nickname is peep tho 😌
My new favorite lil peep song.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This song needs more likes.
This wounderwall sample slap
❤️
Oasis
“Run away from the pain” <br /><br />rip lil peep for ever in our hearts ❤️🙏
It’s sounds like a song from Life Is Strange but its a good thing. <br /><br />But right now.. <br /><br /><br /><b>Life is  s t r a n g e . . .</b>
me listening to this on repeat drinking monsters having a mental breakdown like :)(
if the album is kinda new, how does peep have b the crybaby tattoo.                                also RIP lil peep
This song the night I caught feelings for a dude, he played it while we walked around after dark. I texted my sister and said I liked him and that he was properly beautiful. He doesn&#39;t feel the same and but he&#39;d give me the world if I asked for it. He&#39;s with someone, it hurts but it&#39;s okay, as long as he&#39;s happy
Lil oasis
people do realize this is wonderwall by oasis with a twist right
The only thing I hate about this song is its not longer :(
I love ctmm
Mas essa porra é Wonderwall

I dont wanna be one of &quot;those&quot; nut jobs but this sounds like he still alive. Changed my name shaved my heard tell my friends that im dead. Kinda sus if you ask me
Parts of this song could be the opening to a tv show or sum idk why it just has that vibe
Para los que los que no lo saben, esta canción utiliza la misma instrumentalización que Wonderwall de Oasis.<br />Solo el dato para los que no lo sabían, sé que más del 90% acá lo sabrá, pero para los que nunca habían escuchado Wonderwall se las recomiendo xd<br /><br /><br />Igual me encanta Lil Peep (no tengo hate contra él, lo aclaro pvtos)
Tanto tiempo y aqui sigo, tú música nunca morirá peep ni el sentimiento por que aun duele tu partida a todos nos duele
Dude just stole oasis background music 😂😂
i just got a dog and named him gus his nickname is peep tho 😌
My new favorite lil peep song.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This song needs more likes.
This wounderwall sample slap
❤️
Oasis
“Run away from the pain” <br /><br />rip lil peep for ever in our hearts ❤️🙏
It’s sounds like a song from Life Is Strange but its a good thing. <br /><br />But right now.. <br /><br /><br /><b>Life is  s t r a n g e . . .</b>
me listening to this on repeat drinking monsters having a mental breakdown like :)(
if the album is kinda new, how does peep have b the crybaby tattoo.                                also RIP lil peep
This song the night I caught feelings for a dude, he played it while we walked around after dark. I texted my sister and said I liked him and that he was properly beautiful. He doesn&#39;t feel the same and but he&#39;d give me the world if I asked for it. He&#39;s with someone, it hurts but it&#39;s okay, as long as he&#39;s happy
Lil oasis
people do realize this is wonderwall by oasis with a twist right
The only thing I hate about this song is its not longer :(
I love ctmm

He is an legend
No puedo superar tu muerte, desearía que estuvieses aquí, te merecías el mundo entero. Pequeño ángel, te amamos Peep, abrazos hasta donde quiera que estés :(
Sigo llorando todas las noches, pensando que tú muerte es solo una pesadilla, en cualquier momento me gustaría despertar y saber que aún sigues aquí. La vida no es lo mismo sin ti, pequeño ángel. El tiempo va a pasar cada vez más rápido y seguiremos recordándote con mucho amor, físicamente te has ido, pero siempre vivirás en nuestros corazones. <br />Hoy miré el cielo, vi una estrella y supe que ahí estabas, por tu forma tan hermosa y única de brillar. <br />Descansa en paz pequeño Gus. 🖤
him doing drugs breaks my heart.
Thanks for the clip💜

Listen to this half fadded on xans
💔
People say the collabs with Tracy are the only good collabs but they always forget about this song. This is number one for me
If you haven’t watched this live you’re really really missing out
RIP PEEP❤
when its just peeps voice and he sings &#39;please dont leave me&#39;
T e a m a m o s l i l p e e p ❤❤
Sssooooooo
My best friend just died last night in my arms
This song is old<br />But I love it
Wish he was here
Esto sí era lil peep . Música para mis oídos ♡ gracias por tanto.
😪
Gotta give Wicca credit to his parts fire
This song hit me like a brick 😭
Yoo this is not music this is drug 🤘🏻💀
I can’t believe some kids are hearing this song for the first time!! It absolutely blows my mind🤯🤯 I’ve been BARE listening to this song for a couple years,  still fucks me up and gets me in a mood everytime 💎❤️
I think this is my favorite song from peep 🙏🏽
It want something that I thought about .. but knew-
Wicca&#39;s part is my favorite. It&#39;s the foundation &amp; then Peeps verse intensifies it. Also the lyrics on Wicca&#39;s verse go hard. &quot;There&#39;s a silhouette inside a lucid dream. I project myself on you then back to me&quot;. It gave me chills.
